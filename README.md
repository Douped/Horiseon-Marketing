# Module-1-Challenge.io
Website refractor for challenge 1

The original README for this assignment is kept in the assets folder. When trying to deploy the webpage to github, github was displaying the contents of the README file
instead of the index.html file. I'm sure there's a better way to mitigate this issue and I hope to learn it in time for the next challenge.
